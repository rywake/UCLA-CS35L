First, I wanted the right local outputs so I used the command:
"LC_ALL='C'"
to ensure that it was correct.

Next, I uploaded the webpage of the assignemnt to the server using the command:
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter20/cs35L/assign/assign2.html



tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html : Moves every word or return line to its own line and outputs the result. REPLACES ANY NON-ALPHABETIC CHARACTER WITH A NEW-LINE CHARACTER.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'  < assign2.html  :Moves every word to its own line, ignores return new lines. DOES NOT REPEAT REPLACING A NEWLINE IF THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN ONE USED BEFORE THE WORD.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'  < assign2.html | sort rearranges the lines in alphabetical order

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'  < assign2.html | sort -u : sorts the words but gets rid of repeats.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'  < assign2.html | sort -u | comm - words : Sorted list of all the words that were found in file 2 but not in file 1 (html file)

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'  < assign2.html | sort -u | comm -23 - words # ENGLISHCHECKER :Prints only words unique to file 1, that aren't found in the english disctionary. (Looks like includes capitalized words).


Next, I downloaded a copy of the hawaiian website to the server using the command:
wget https://www.mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdshw.htm

In order to delete the text needed to be deleted i used the commands:
tr -d '<u>' <hwords >hwords
tr -d '</u>' <hwords
tr -d '?' <hwords

This will delete any instances that these characters appear in the text file:

[ ]*<td[^>]*>[mhawaiian]*<\/td>[ ]*

I then used the rest of the commands found in buildwords to remove all words and characters except those found in Hawaiian words.


To check for misspelled words in the assignment webpage I used the following command :

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -fu | comm -23 - words > misspelledEng

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -fu | comm -23 - hwords > misspelledHwn

After using the commands:

wc -w misspelledEng
wc -w misspelledHwn

I learned that there were a toral of 48 misspelled english words on the webpage and 548 misspelled hawaiian words.

Examples of misspelled english words on the webpage are:
charset
crlf
ctype

And examples of misspelled Hawaiian words on the webpage are:
about
above
accent
