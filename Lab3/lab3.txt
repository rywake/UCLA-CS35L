I used the command: 
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz 

to extract the tarball online. Next I used the command:

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

to extraxt the signature of teh file, and finally i used the command:

wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

to extract the keyring.

Once I had the tarball from above, I unzipped it using:
tar -xJf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz 
This gives me access to all of the files and directories from the tarball.

Finally, I verified the signature of the
coreutils source code using the command:

gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

This outputted the following text: 

gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: /u/ma/ugrad/ryan/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

It is giving a warning that the key isn't certified with a trusted 
signature and there is no indication that the signature 
belongs to the owner.

Next, we want to append the file path of the core_utils so we can compile 
it outside of its directory. In order to change the path, 
go into the core_utils directory and use the command:

./configure --prefix=/u/ma/ugrad/ryan/cs35l/lab3/unpatched_core

This will set the prefix in the core_util file to go to 
the unpatched_core directory I created somewhere else on the server.

Finally, i ran "make" and "make install" to make an 
exectuable version of the software.

Next, we want to reproduce the bug that occurs in version 8.29. 
To do this, I looked at the Bug webpage and found that the 
issue occurs when the command "unpatched_core/bin/ls -fA is run. It 
still list the . and .. follows in the list when the -A flag should 
restrict those from being listed, but the other flag will override 
it. We need to install the patch to fix this issue.

The first problem that occured was when trying to use wget to download 
this file. It would create an error and terminate without creating 
the file, so i had to manually copy and paste the text into a file.
After copying this patch into a file called bug_patch, i ran the patch command:

"patch -p1 < ../bug_patch" 

as the bug_patch was in the previous directory. This gave me the output 

1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
patching file tests/local.mk
Hunk #1 FAILED at 575.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file tests/local.mk.rej
patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh

However, the result did say that the file was patched.


Next i used the "make" command so it would compile the coreutils directory, 
but would not recompile "unpatched_core". Just to make sure I 
had a saved copy of the patch, I made a new directory:

"mkdir patch_core"

and then installed the patch to that 
directory first by changing the configure path:

"./configure --prefix=/u/ma/ugrad/ryan/cs35l/lab3/patch_core" 

and then by using the command:

"make install" in the core_utils directory.

I checked to make sure the patch was downloaded successfully by going 
into the patch_core directory and then running the command:

"./bin/ls -aA /u/ma/ugrad/ryan/cs35l/lab3/"

This threw me an error, not ouputting what I wanted, so I went 
into coreutils and used the command "autoreconf -fi" I retried 
using the command in the patched directory, and this time it 
outputted the files in the directory, but this did not 
output any . and .. files, so the file was successfully patched.

The other way we could have tested it was byf going into 
the coreutils direcotry and running the command:
 
"./src/ls -aA"

I ran this command and it outputted the files in this directory, but not 
the . and .. files. Once again this shows that the patch was successful.
